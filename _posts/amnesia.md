## How Soon We Forget! 

Relinquishing the past can be a way to liberate us from our previous baggage. However, we rarely are able to preserve our positive experiences in the process, and we are still left with the
much stickier negative ones. We take on the painful, and challenging memories and our brains shovel on top our fears and anxieties, emotionally charging them and distorting them. I quickly forget an instance where I overcame a difficulty earlier in the day, but whenever stepping into the shower I become haunted with gaffs I've made over a decade ago.

It is no wonder whenever we find ourselves in a new situation we trend towards feeling unworthy, ill-equipped, and project that onto our cohorts. "Everyone here must think I'm a complete dunce."
Even the most qualified individuals seem to suffer from this phenomenon. No one is immune!


## How Do We Solve This?

The short answer is: we can't. At best we can mitigate, and lessen the effects. Perhaps some actions we can take are as follows:

  * **Journaling/Blogging:** Document your wins and losses. This allows for reflection to "rebase" ourselves and remind us how far we've come! 

  * **Community:** Locate people who want to see you succeed who can act as a mirror for you. They will engage in presenting you with valid, yet tempered, criticism and let you know whenever you've done well, and give you a better idea of the scope of your failures (assuring you that everyone doesn't actually hate you) and how to improve.

  * **Patience:** Understand that growth takes time, and it can be uncomfortable for a while. Give yourself the space to reflect and be kind to yourself while you work towards your goals.

  * **Empathy**: Know that everyone around us experiences these same feelings. Not only let that bring to you ease, but aim to help others understand how you're going through similar emotions so that they can be brought into ease also.


I'll try to come back to this list as a reminder, and to add to it as I continue to learn how to deal with these emotions. 

Thanks for reading!
