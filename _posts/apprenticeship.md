## Crumpled Dreams

Becoming a software developer has been a dream of mine ever since I was in middle school. I've always been fascinated by those who could take their imaginations and make them almost tangible, weaving them into new worlds and realities with code. I began writing small websites, embedding as many obnoxious GIFs and sounds as possible, to show off to my friends. I was deeply in love and constantly craved for more.

Life carried on and eventually I found myself, with much frisson, at university in pursuit of a degree in Computer Science. However, it quickly was apparent that I had not equipped myself well to take on this new venture. I promptly became homesick, depressed, and I performed poorly in my classwork. I came there with so much hope to fulfill the dream I had brought in with me, but I left with it entirely shattered. After years of trying not to give in and to cling to what little hope I had left, I had to come to terms with simply not being adequate, and it was finally over..

## Actually Just Beginning

I began a game of "career hopscotch" where I aimed to plow a new path forward and to reinvent myself. I had not ever considered what I would do if I failed to realize a career in programming, so I was forced to try numerous types of jobs to find a good fit. However, at seemingly every step of the way, I found that I could apply what little software development knowledge I had to do things such as logging calls, automating food orders, monitoring kitchen equipment, compiling spreadsheets-- you name it! Not a single position I held was not able to be made more efficient and pleasant through writing software. Admittedly, it was always difficult to bring myself to implement these programs as each time I felt the sting of inadequacy as I approached a new problem; I believed it would be a waste of time to create software as it wouldn't ever work, or if it did it would simply implode due to being poorly written. However, I found that with each project I undertook that I was able to accomplish more than I previously thought.

One night I was mindlessly scrolling through my various social media feeds whenever I came across a post soliciting assistance in a software project geared towards an online video game my brother had recently introduced to me. The game was being overrun by bots, and the poster wanted to create a machine learning system, using predictive modeling via a multi-class classification algorithm, to try to identify the bots en masse and get them banned from the game. I reached out to him, and began working on making small improvements to what he had created. 

Soon a few other developers joined on as well, and the rate of progression we reach accelerated greatly. It was quite a struggle to keep apace with the project, but it was easilythe most fun I've had in years. Everyone brought different expertise to the group, and we all learned immensely from each other. It was (and still is) amazing! I couldn't believe that I almost gave up on developing software completely! To date we've helped to ban over 530,000 bots, and we've gone from storing our data in pickle files all the way to distributing our application across numerous microservices and ingesting on average around 400,000 player sightings each 5 minutes period. It has been an amazing learning experience as we've scaled, and it has helped to mend the shattered confidence I had been dragging behind me since failing my educational pursuits. 

Side note: You can view the bot detection project's README **[here](https://github.com/Bot-detector/bot-detector/blob/master/README.md)** to learn more about what we do. It's still quite a messy codebase, but we've deliberated upon a 2022 roadmap and exciting improvements (automated testing, cleaner code, monitoring to name a few!) are in the works!

## Building Bridges

Now, like many of you reading this, I'm embarking on this new endeavor called Develop Carolina to help bridge the developer I am today towards becoming a much more competent and effective author of software in the future. I'm already blown away about how eager the mentors and leaders in the program are to nurture us as we grow and learn together. With the intentional cirriculum, passionate teachers, real-world experience, and vast resources available I am thrilled to see how much we can improve over the duration of the fellowship.

The educational portion of this program conveys numerous learning objectives, and I will try to come out on the other side with a firm grasp of them them all. While working at my host company I will strive to absorb the best practices, attitudes, and philosophies on how to create and maintain software on enormous scales with millions of users. I will pick the brains of my mentors and learn from their experiences and advice while being vulnerable in expressing my questions and struggles. I aim to excel at all of these, but after this is all over, the thing I most desperately want is to have a firm, well-grounded, backed-up by skills and knowledge **confidence** that will not be so easily shaken again. 

I will not be able to master every topic in these 6 months, I will still have countless questions, and I will have plenty of areas where I will need to improve. Despite this, I want to leave knowing that I *can* overcome these challenges and that I *can* create meaningful software to help make this world a better place. One way or another, I will leave here know I am not an imposter, and that I belong.
