Dear Future Matt,

By the time you revisit this letter, I hope you've been able to overcome the challenges set before you and continue to have grown in not only your professional endeavors, but also in your character, faith, and relationship with Laura. Just in case you've forgotten, you're reading what was written by a worn, fickle-hope bearing, and slightly overwhelmed version of yourself. It's been an extremely trying last 12 months, and there were just so many countless times you've wanted to fold and buckle under the weight of the seemingly endless expanse of hopeless wandering. Please... I plead for you to recall all of those late nights where you fell, shattered, and Laura was there to hold you, your family who has never stopped praying for you and supporting you, and the friends who always had their doors open for you to seek comfort through. Whether or not you ultimately exceed in this journey in becoming a software developer, do not ever forget how incredibly blessed you are, and where your true riches lie. Your worth is not tied to your performance, you have nothing to prove, and there is so much more to your life than this career you're pursuing.

Keep working hard, remember to call your mom, give Laura a giant hug, and don't forget to feed Penelope.

Sincerely,

Matt v01.28.22
