Due to my father's occupation at the time we were one of the first households in my area to get wired for dial-up internet. He was required to be able to "dial-in" (literally) remotely in to his employer's mainframe in order to
perform various job functions. I can faintly recall (I was at most a few years old) the tension it created whenever my dad was on-call and our phone line had to be kept open, disallowing the rest of the family from making phone calls.
Luckily, it was only a few years later that we were able to switch to broadband service.

It's difficult for me to conceptualize the world without the Internet and personal computing being a major component of our daily activities. I often wonder what life would be like if technical progress took another course, and it's my tendency to assume the alternatives to our present situation would be preferable. Would the pace of change be more bearable, our communities more intact, our work more delineated from our homes, and our privacy be less at risk if the Internet had not been unleashed from its Pandora's Box onto an ill-prepared world? It's impossible to be sure, but the more I ponder upon the matter the more I am convinced that the Internet and how it operates is merely a reflection of mankind's hearts and desires, and if not the Internet it would be some other technological funnel that would be employed to garner the same effects.

I don't mean to imply that the Internet is inherently evil, but do want to accentuate some of its drawbacks. As developers we have an exciting opportunity to use this amoral platform to advocate for good and bring about positive outcomes from the applications we choose to write. Let's do our best to steer this techonology that is still in its infancy towards edifying the greater public and prevent it from being gatekept like so many other advancements before.
