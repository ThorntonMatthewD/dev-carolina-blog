### "At the intersection of 'Desirability', 'Viability', and 'Feasibility' lies a very distraught developer."

It is no small task to be able to take an idea from its conception and nurture it into a mature product. Even more difficult is leading a product to maturity that people actually want to use. 

Over the last year myself and a business partner tried launching two separate companies-- one being a virtual reality entertainment service and the other being a mobile device management consultancy for parents. Whenever working in a small, bootstrapping startup you typically do not have a comprehensive product management team (and for us this was especially the case) and everyone has to wear many different hats. I was apprehensive to take the reins of the business end of things, focusing squarely on the feasibility of our offerings and the technical implementations, and often deferred to my partner to take on matters outside of that scope. I lacked the knowledge as to how to navigate these areas, and didn't have a great feel for the groups we were trying to serve. I let fear and ignorance guide my decisions.

With that approach, it's no wonder that our endeavors fell short. We did not have a proper roadmap, we were not always intentional about adjusting our services to meet market demands for fear of cost overruns, and I honestly felt like we were flying blind as we did not do a great job at gathering analytics and feedback. There is just an immense array of skills and knowledge needed to execute a product launch well, and it is overwhelming to try and acquire everything necessary in the midst of a rollout.

### My Takeaways

I am so grateful for my failures, and that they were not the end. Without them I could not nearly appreciate my position today: I have been placed with a company that has a robust network of administrative support and leadership who address every deficiency I've experienced in my previous endeavors. As a result I do not have to venture out into the areas I'm less familiar with that innundated me in the past, and I can work to excel in my craft as a developer. I also get to use this time, without the panic-inducing urgency, to learn these concepts so that in the future I might take another crack at bringing some of these nagging ideas to fruition.

My gratitude to the amazing product management leaders and professionals who refine visions, roadmaps, and help to keep things on track has never been greater!
