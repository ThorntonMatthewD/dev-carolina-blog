This is an exercise in resolution. I'm not always sure what is going on around me, and I often feel sorely out of place. I swear, the person I just talked to speaks exclusively in initialisms and acronyms-- all of which I cannot decipher. I imagine this must be how it's like to be my cat whenever her humans babble at her and the world is so much larger than she (though, I'm certain she's never grappled with imposter syndrome). Sometimes I'm scared to turn on my webcam, wondering if I'll just prove myself a fool. *What if I stumble? What if I fall?*

Five weeks means that it's now been thirty-five times that we've, with much courage, made the decision to press forward and to not give into the doubts and insecurities that attempt to derail us. I am sure that without my mentors, the BAG+AG Gang, teammates, and everyone at Develop Carolina I would have all but caved by now. Their guidance, patience, understanding, and support continue to keep me motivated and on track to make it to the finish line. With each day it becomes easier to continue on, and I am so thankful for all of those who have helped along the way.

At BAH we will soon be entering into a cycle of development where we begin to implement features and changes within the application we've inherited. After weeks of comprehensive research and investigations we are about to trial our assumptions and start work to create much-desired features and fixes for our client. We've spent the last few weeks team-building and setting up our environments, and it's both exciting and a little terrifying to be moving forward into our next stages. I have no doubts, however, that our teams will rise to the challenge and I am delighted to get to be a part of it. I've already learned so much from all of the folks at my host company, many of whom are not even on my team, and I'm greatly looking forward to what's next!
