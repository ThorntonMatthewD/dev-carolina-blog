## Trying Not to Drive Off the Ledge

Recently us cohorts have taking to pursuing the art of working collectively to tackle various programming challenges. In pairs, we have become warriors in the the great [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/). As the battles rage on, it is quickly apparent that the skills needed to successfully operate as a team to vanquish these foes are by a large majority non-technical skills. It takes a "driver" who is able to listen while typing, not being dismissive of the input they are receiving. The navigator must be resourceful and patient as many of their suggestions may go seemingly ignored for a time as the driver attempts to balance their numerous input streams. It may take quite some time for the two minds to synchronize, but if they do not give up they will surely be victorious!

It has taken me quite some time to get accustomed to the pace of pair programming, but getting to see how my partners have been able to pursue solutions so differently than I would have and how the exercise edifies us both, it makes me want to continue working with others far beyond this week's module.

Huge shoutouts to Aaron and Ariana! You guys rock, and it's been an honor fighting alongside you!

From the Battlefield,
