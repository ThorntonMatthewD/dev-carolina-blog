Formerly I was in the business of implementing and deploying online ordering solutions for restaurants, and my role straddled the line between salesman and technical consultant. After walking through the process of selling to and creating online menus with the first few customers, I was able to use their commonalities to draw out a road map for onboarding future clients. This framework became a guide that I could use to anticipate the needs and desires of restaurant owners to more effectively and efficiently get them online. With each new completion came refinements to the process, and an extra entry in the portfolio to help new customers see what their own site can look like.

Before initially making a pitch, I would always go through a set of questions to better my chances at success:

- Eat at the restaurant. Try to see how online ordering would fit into their current flow. Identify pain points that it could relieve (do their hosts/hostess have a phone glued to their head at dinner?).

- Take pictures of the menus (all of them!!) and specials boards.

- Find a restaurant that is similar to the prospective customer that is using online ordering already, and copy their menu over to a demo site.

- If the prospective online ordering customer is already a customer in another capacity, find out which vendors will need to be contacted in addition to streamline the process (credit card processors, delivery representatives, website administrators, etc...)

Being prepared allowed for a higher throughput through our sales pipeline while giving the customer, and their end users, the best experience possible. The more I would prepare, the more likely there was a positive outcome. I never once regretted over-preparing, but I sure did whenever I didn't prepare enough!
