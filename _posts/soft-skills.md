Our prompt this week (well, last week-- I'm a bit behind) was posed to allow us reflect upon our non-technical skills that we can use to assist ourselves in the world of software development (and beyond).

These often intangible skills, pretty much by definition, are difficult to qualify, and honestly they're often overlooked.. That is of course until someone who is otherwise perfected capable of performing direct duties for a technical position comes into a team while lacking these "soft" skills, and it becomes painfully obvious how important they are.

I've been confronted with this realization in the past of myself where I have been the person lacking certain abilities (mainly in the social/relational realm) which caused friction between myself and my teammates. I had to come to an understanding that to succeed in any field one cannot solely focus on facts and formulas but they also need to be a well-rounded individual.

The largest aid to help me out of this slump was to pick a few hobbies to try and get connected with groups of local enthusiasts for each activity. Taking up things like gardening, backpacking, HAM radio operating, mead brewing, etc, while doing them with other passionate people helped to round out my weak spots and it has probably aided me in my career more than any CS textbook or programming course ever could.

Having experienced the positive effects of working with a motivated group of people to accomplish something you all love is what continues to drive me to try to excel in my software development pursuits while keeping my perspective on what truly matters: you. And everyone else I receive the pleasure to work with. Let us not only build applications, but also build up each other. As long as we are working with that as our goal I know that the value we will bring to any team or employer will be very tangible, and immeasurable.
