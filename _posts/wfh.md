Transitioning towards working from home has been an extremely rough experience for me. Here is how it all went down: 

In the Spring of 2020 I was asked to work from home for a few weeks while my company gathered information about how to safely proceed with operations in light of a virus spreading quickly through our world. At first I was ecstatic! While working in my office I would constantly be approached with questions (I was an SME for several platforms that surged in use during the onset of the pandemic), the phone would ring, the UPS courier would knock on the door.. I was unable to enter a "flow state" and perform any meaningful amount of work. Whenever I began working at home, all of those distractions and interruptions faded away. I think on my first day I got more crossed off of my to-do list than I had done in the three weeks prior. It was amazing! 

My one-hour-each-way commute was also no more, and I suddenly had 10 extra hours each week to use however I saw fit-- I no longer had to spend them sitting in gridlock on I-85 white-knuckling my steering wheel hoping the impatient stream of jagoffs weaving through traffic with their Georgia plates wouldn't be the end of me. I could spend my lunches performing household chores so that whenever the business day ended I could go straight into winding down. I'm pretty sure my average resting heartbeat dropped by about 10% in that first week.

It didn't take long for the feeling of isolation to creep in. My wife remained on-site with her employer, so everyday I was left alone in an empty apartment with only my cat to keep me company. Days would go by without me speaking a single word until my wife returned home. Many business were closed, and my main space of recreation was the very same as what I had used all day for my work. The area I live in isn't very walkable, and with seemingly no where to retreat to I was left feeling trapped as if in a tiny cell. Malaise turned into misery, and I slid into the realm of gloomy fog much like the dwelling place of the Cimmerians in Homer's Odyssey. I was so relieved whenever I was brought back into the office, and I had no intention of ever returning to working at home.

Nearly two [long] years have passed, and I am once again operating from my home. This time I will not let the darkness prevail. I no longer rely on my employment to be the main source of my social interactions. I realized that I needed to lead a life apart from my employer, and that activities such as fitness, hobbies, and nutrition needed to be higher priorities in order to be able to adapt to and endure unforeseen that may crop up in the era of COVID. I also needed to invest time and money into improving my home office to reduce friction and pain points while also promoting my ability to collaborate with others as much as doing so remotely can afford. 

These adjustments are what make working from home more enjoyable to me these days. Whenever our careers are framed in the correct perspective in relation to the whole of our lives, it allows us to be more flexible and to be able to thrive in times of adversity. Our work no longer becomes the source of our emotional sustenance and we are much better off for it. Incidentally enough, I believe it works in favor of our employers in heightened productivity and employee retention.

I still hope to one day return to an office setting, but I am at peace with the possibility of that never happening.
